# VAM-Work
Sources used for value-added models research.

Right now I just have some files from a British Journal of Education Psychology paper that examines whether VAMs are fair to schools that serve predominantly students from historical low performing groups. These models are likely not fair, but it depends if the covariate (the prior test scores) influence the school/teacher the student is with.
